Why rust?

I wanted something low level to have control over memory/performance, C and C++ would be my goto for this case but I've been getting tired of C-langs, plus setting up their dev env and build pipeline is annoying AF (I'll admit I got a CMakeLists skill issue)

I wanted to try learn rust in a small self-contained project, its got a nice package manager with `cargo` and having a simple build/run pipeline out of the box is a nice to have.
